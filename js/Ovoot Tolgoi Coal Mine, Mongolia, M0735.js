The extent of the Sunset Pit polygon was delineated from the 2023 plan map and imagery consistent with site conditions as of 2023. This open pit appears to overlap with part of the Nariin Sukhait Coal Mine, Mongolia, M0732 project area. The overlapping project areas are associated with different owners, with the Nariin Sukhait Coal Mine operated by Mongolyn Alt LLC and the Ovoot Tolgoi coal mine operated by SouthGobi Sands LLC. The approximate area of the resulting boundary is 2 square km.",

The extent of the Sunrise Pit polygon was delineated from the 2023 plan map and imagery consistent with site conditions as of 2023. This open pit appears to overlap with part of the Nariin Sukhait Coal Mine project area. The overlapping project areas are associated with different owners, with the Nariin Sukhait Coal Mine operated by Mongolyn Alt LLC and the Ovoot Tolgoi coal mine operated by SouthGobi Sands LLC. The approximate area of the resulting boundary is 3 square km.",
