The diagram was overlayed in Google Earth Pro and the boundary of the total \"project land allotment\" was extracted manually. The boundary includes the areas of both relevant mining lease boundaries, as well as the processing and handling facility and the adjacent areas used for the mine's waste coal disposal. The approximate area of the total boundary polygon is 73.85 square km.",
